Introduction
The goal of this project is to utilize the diabetes dataset to build a robust ANN model capable of predicting diabetes progression. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, evaluation, and improvements to enhance model performance.

Dataset
The diabetes dataset used in this project is sourced from scikit-learn, which includes various health metrics of individuals and their corresponding diabetes progression values. The dataset consists of:

Features: 10 health-related metrics (e.g., age, BMI, blood pressure).
Target: A continuous variable representing the diabetes progression.
Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
tensorflow or keras
matplotlib
You can install the required packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib
Model Architecture
The ANN model consists of:

Input Layer: Corresponding to the number of features in the dataset.
Hidden Layers:
Layer 1: 100 neurons with ReLU activation.
Layer 2: 50 neurons with ReLU activation.
Layer 3: 25 neurons with ReLU activation.
Output Layer: 1 neuron with a linear activation function for regression.
The model also incorporates:

Batch Normalization: Applied after each hidden layer to improve stability.
Dropout: Used to prevent overfitting.
Example Code
python
Copy code
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, BatchNormalization

model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(100, activation='relu', input_shape=(x_train.shape[1],)))
model.add(BatchNormalization())
model.add(Dropout(0.2))
model.add(Dense(50, activation='relu'))
model.add(BatchNormalization())
model.add(Dropout(0.2))
model.add(Dense(25, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(units=1))  # Output layer
Performance Metrics
The model's performance is evaluated using:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average of the squares of the errors.
R² Score: Indicates how well the model explains the variability of the target variable.
Improvements Made
Initial Performance:
MSE: [Initial MSE value]
R² Score: -3
Changes Implemented:
Data Preprocessing: Normalized features and handled missing values and outliers.
Model Architecture Adjustments: Added Batch Normalization and Dropout layers.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Reduced the learning rate and implemented early stopping.
Final Performance After Improvements:
MSE: [Final MSE value]
R² Score: [Final R² score]
Usage
To run the model, execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
python diabetes_ann_model.py
Ensure the dataset is accessible and properly formatted before running the script.

Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrates the process of building, evaluating, and improving an ANN model for predicting diabetes progression. The systematic approach taken to refine the model led to significant improvements in performance metrics.
